Environmental Data

Risk Management

Hitachi identifies, evaluates, and manages climate change- related risks by business unit and Group company to deter- mine environmental impacts and other factors. The results are tabulated by the Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd., and those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the Group as a whole are deliberated and decided by the Senior Executive Committee and, if neces- sary, by the Board of Directors as well.

Metrics and Target

Hitachi defines medium- to long-term metrics and targets in the Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 long-term environ- mental targets. We also establish and manage short-term metrics and targets in detail every three years through the Environmental Action Plan.

Metrics for climate change mitigation and adaptation use total COz emissions and the reduction rate in COz emissions per unit. Total CO2 emissions from the use of sold products in Scope 3, which account for most of our emissions given the nature of Hitachi’s business, fluctuate greatly due to changes in sales volumes and our business portfolio. This has the disadvantage of making it difficult to see the results of energy saving and efficiency improvements. Therefore, we have established COz emissions per unit as a metric for providing customers and society with products and services that offer equivalent value while emitting less COz. We also set and manage a metric for avoided emissions that contribute to the realization of a decarbonized society as a whole.

We continue to reduce COz emissions generated at our own business sites (factories and offices) by utilizing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing (HICP) system, which provides incentives for capital investments that contribute to COz reductions. The carbon price for HICP is set at 14,000 yen per ton-COsz.

In addition, in April 2021, Hitachi, Ltd. introduced evalua- tions that take environmental value into account in the execu- tive compensation system with a view to accelerating the creation of environmental value toward achievement of long- term environmental targets.

Achieving a Resource-Efficient Society

Efforts to Achieve a Resource-Efficient Society GRI2-19/2-24/3-9

Environmental issues continue to intensify associated with increased economic and social activities within the conven- tional linear economy of mass production, mass consump- tion, and mass disposal. These problems involve resource shortages, water scarcity, tight supply and demand for energy, environmental pollution caused by increasing waste, global warming, and the loss of biodiversity. To solve these problems and create sustainable societies, we must shift away from linear economies to circular economies. Hitachi works together with customers and society to help build a society that uses water and other resources efficiently.

Ollnitiatives to Achieve a Resource-Efficient Society

Initiatives in the Value Chain

Hitachi considers the circularity of resources across the value chain to be of key importance. We also believe in the impor- tance of water usage reduction that takes into consideration water risks on a region-by-region basis at each stage of the supply chain. Accordingly, we drive circular-design initiatives and development tools, applications, and services that help facilitate circular economies, and optimize water usage and wastewater treatment in the supply chain, provide water- efficient products and services.

Initiatives at Business Sites

We established a long-term environmental target to improve the efficiency with which water and other resources are used by fiscal 2050. The actual goal is to improve efficiency by 50% compared to fiscal 2010. In addition, we will create higher economic value using fewer resources while pursuing production activities with a lower environmental burden.

Note: Our response to water risks that take biodiversity into consideration are detailed in Efforts to Achieve a Society Harmonized With Nature (P.055)."

recycling, making continuous efforts to devise strategies for the most efficient utilization of resources and assets. To this end, we share our goals with various stakeholders in the value chain and pursue collaborative creation. Additionally, we pursue research and development involving raw materials, products, tools, applications, and services necessary for our goals, leveraging the advantages of Hitachi’s IT x Operational Technology (OT) x Products to support create circular economies not only in our value chain, but in customer activities as well.

q P.038 Improving the Environmental Performance of Products and Services Through Eco-Design

Building a Society That Uses Resources Efficiently

Approach to Transitioning to a Circular Economy

To help build a society that uses resources efficiently, Hitachi will advance a shift from the conventional linear economy to a circular economy. Therefore, we will focus on how we can continue to use resources and assets in our business activi- ties and reduce waste, or even eliminate waste altogether, using three approaches: innovation in upstream product design, innovation in the product manufacturing process, and innovation of our business model.

@ Innovation in Product Design

Through Environmentally Conscious Design Assessments and Life Cycle Assessments for new products that involve design activities, we will reduce waste by standardizing parts, extending service life, utilizing recycled materials, and design- ing for easy recyclability. To this end, we revised the Hitachi Eco Design Management Guidelines and Hitachi Eco Design Activity Guidelines to reflect the latest international trends. At the same time, we set a clear goal to apply the relevant assessments to all new products involving design activities and to achieve this goal by fiscal 2024.

We share case studies among divisions to highlight initiatives in this area. Case studies include product and parts manufac- turing volume optimization based on an understanding of supply and demand, digitization of design processes for paperless work, the reduction of packaging material usage, the reduction of defective products through quality improve- ment, and the reduction of chemical substances. Further, we established specific targets for the number of sites achieving the goal of the Zero Waste to Landfill initiative, as well as for

effective utilization rates related to plastic waste. In particular, we initiated activities targeting all manufacturing sites this fiscal year with the aim of achieving Zero Waste to Landfill*'.

Management of Waste and Valuables Generated at Business Sites

We collect environmental load data for waste and valuables*' generated at the business sites using the Environmental Data Collection System (Eco-DS) to manage centrally the volumes of waste and valuables generated and exported by type. For hazardous waste, in particular, we ensure thorough compli- ance with laws and regulations, and engage in proper dis- posal within the Group.

For fiscal 2022, which was the first year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2024 (fiscal 2022-2024), we established a 14% per-unit reduction target (compared with a base year of fiscal 2010) for waste and valuables gener- ated. We outperformed this target by achieving a reduction of 16%.

We reduced the amount of waste and valuables gener- ated by 70 kt, or 23%, compared to the base year. We accomplished this result by installing recycling facilities within our business sites, as well as through closed-loop recycling, whereby byproducts and scrap from the produc- tion process are reused as resources by other business sites, while packing and cushioning materials for transporta- tion are used repeatedly.

“1 Waste and valuables: Materials generated through business activities. Each country has a legal definition of waste, and in Japan, the term refers to refuse, bulky refuse, ashes, sludge, excreta, waste oil, waste acid and alkali, car- casses, and other filthy and unnecessary matter, which are in a solid or liquid state according to the Waste Management and Public Cleansing Law. Valuables, meanwhile, are those materials left over after business activities other than waste, and can be sold or transferred free of charge to other parties as items of value.

Number of Sites Achieving the Goal of the Zero Waste to Landfill Initiative

We pursue activities to achieve the goals of the Zero Waste to Landfill*’ initiative, which seeks to minimize landfill disposal for the ongoing, sustainable utilization of resources. This fiscal year, we set specific targets for the number of manufacturing sites to achieve zero landfill waste, and we are stepping up efforts to accelerate this initiative. In fiscal 2022, 199 of the sites covered by our activities achieved zero landfill waste

Effective Utilization Rate of Plastic Waste

We began strengthening our activities in fiscal 2022 toward achieving a 100% effective utilization*' rate of waste plastics throughout the entire Hitachi Group by fiscal 2080. In fiscal 2022, we set an effective utilization rate target of 77% and achieved 88%. To improve the effective utilization rate, we are implementing measures that include design changes for equipment and products that do not generate waste, digitiza- tion of operations for paperless work, reduction of waste through yield improvements, in-house reuse, sorting and accumulation waste to enhance value, and recycling mea- sures through detailed sorting

Note: All manufacturing sites are covered

Hitachi Global Life Solutions, whose plastic consumption accounts for around 70% of the Hitachi Group’s total, uses recycled plastic in parts for washing machines and refrigera- tors and packing materials for ceiling lights. The company procures recycled plastic materials produced within the Hitachi Group, such as plastic parts recovered from end-of-life home appliances and plastic containers, and also uses recy- cled plastics sourced from other materials manufacturers

While large components in washing machines (enclosure bases in the lower parts of units, etc.) were previously made using a mixture of new and recycled materials, the company shifted to almost 100% recycled plastics, achieved by solving technical problems and procurement issues

Hitachi Global Life Solutions works to recycle four catego- ries of end-of-life home appliances (air conditioners, TVs refrigerators/freezers, and washing machines/dryers) at 19 recycling plants as part of cooperative efforts among five companies”? in response to the 2001 Act on Recycling of Specified Home Appliances. A total of 91.3 kt of recyclable materials*® were recovered in fiscal 2022, of which approxi- mately 81.9 kt were recycled.

Management of Water Use at Business Sites

For fiscal 2022, the first year of the Environmental Action Plan for 2024 (fiscal 2022-2024), we set a target reduction of 22% (compared with a base year of fiscal 2010) in water use per unit for manufacturing process and general daily usage in manufacturing sites. We improved on this target with a reduc- tion of 27%. We reduced the volume of water used by 11 million m%, equivalent to a reduction of 45% compared with the base year. Our measures to reduce water usage included more stringent management of water intake using flowmeters, installing water pipes above ground for better leakage control, recirculating cooling water, and reusing purified waste water.

Hitachi is a comprehensive water services provider that has built a solid track record of experience and expertise in operational technology (OT), products, and services in the sector. We con- tribute to the effective use of limited water resources by address- ing the many issues facing our customers in the water and sewage treatment business. We achieve these results by lever- aging a combination of our IT, extensive experience, and consid- erable expertise in a variety of fields. A recent example includes our joint venture with Mizu Mirai Hiroshima Corporation, which was awarded a contract by Hiroshima Prefecture to build a

wide-area monitoring and control system for nine prefectural water treatment plants. This project involves designing and build- ing a system that monitors and operates facilities centrally via a common cloud-based platform. The system handles data from different systems with different specifications supplied by various vendors, as well as data from software that utilizes Hitachi's digital technology. This project will contribute to wide-area control and management and as digitization (DX) in the water industry.

We are also engaged in verification tests and joint research with national and local governments, companies, and other organi- zations in various countries to establish new technologies and systems for the water business. These joint activities include recent work with Higashine City, Yamagata Prefecture, on inte- grated flood control measures. The actual research involved technologies for real-time flood forecasting and for simulating evacuations and emergencies. We also demonstrated the effectiveness of the technologies that were part of this research. In addition, we began joint research with Water Agency Inc., whose business includes water and sewage treatment opera- tions, to develop a practical Al/loT-based sludge-reduction service for sewage treatment plants.
