We improved on this target with a reduc- tion of 27%. We reduced the volume of water used by 11 million m%, equivalent to a reduction of 45% compared with the base year. Our measures to reduce water usage included more stringent management of water intake using flowmeters, installing water pipes above ground for better leakage control, recirculating cooling water, and reusing purified waste water."
