# ReportParse

ReportParse is a Python-based tool designed to parse corporate (sustainability) reports.
It combines document structure analysis with natural language processing (NLP) models to extract sustainability-related information from the reports.
We also provide easy-to-use web and command interfaces.
The tool is expected to aid researchers and analysts in evaluating corporate commitment to and management of sustainability efforts.
Read our IJCAI 2024 demonstration paper "ReportParse: A Unified NLP Tool for Extracting Document Structure and Semantics of Corporate Sustainability Reporting" for technical detail.

## FAQs

- Can we use it for any PDF files other than sustainability reports?
  - Technically yes. However, we do not actively support genral reports or other PDF files.
